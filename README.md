# Sales Interview Prep Platform

Practice adversarial sales roleplays with AI buyers for top B2B tech companies. Master discovery, objection handling, and closing under pressure.

## 🎯 What This Does

This platform simulates realistic, challenging sales calls where AI plays skeptical buyers who won't make it easy for you. Each scenario is based on real interview roleplays used by top sales organizations.

## 📋 Available Scenarios

### Cursor @ Figma (Hard)
- **Your Role**: Account Executive at Cursor
- **Challenge**: Navigate hostile security concerns to discover an engineering reorg
- **Success**: Position Cursor as the solution for velocity during organizational change

### Anthropic @ Fortune 500 FinServ (Hard)
- **Your Role**: Enterprise AE at Anthropic  
- **Challenge**: Convince a skeptical CTO who thinks AI is overhyped
- **Success**: Discover governance mandate and position Claude's safety approach

### Baseten @ Series B Startup (Medium)
- **Your Role**: Account Executive at Baseten
- **Challenge**: Help a frustrated VP Eng who's drowning in ML infrastructure
- **Success**: Discover delayed feature launch and secure technical evaluation

## 🚀 How It Works
